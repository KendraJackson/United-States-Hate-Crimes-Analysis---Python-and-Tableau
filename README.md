# United-States-Hate-Crime-Analysis---Python-and-Tableau

## Project Summary
This repository provides an exploratory analysis, regression analysis, and cluster analysis of American Hate Crime data from 1991-2018. The focus of this analysis was to uncover key insights as to where the most hate crime occurs, whom it occurs against, and what type of hate crime is performed. Additonally, regression and cluster analysis were performed to determine linearity between appropraite variables and look for additional patterns within the data.

## Key Questions
1. What type of hate crimes occur the most frequently?
2. Which groups are the most affected by hate crimes (experiencing increased prejudice)?
3. Which states have the most hate crimes reported throughout the recorded period (1991-2018)

## Disclaimer:
The Hate Crime Statistics Program of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program collects data cross country regarding criminal offenses that were motivated, in part or wholly, by the offender's bias or prejudice against a race, gender, gender identity, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. These crimes are committed against persons, property, or society. The data used for this analysis is administrative in nature and is publicly available from Kaggle. The data is open-source and downloaded from the FBI: Crime Data Explorer. Data is collected on an annual basis.
